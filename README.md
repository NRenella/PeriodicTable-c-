# PeriodicTable-c-
A program that reads in a periodic table and stores it in an array using pointers and linked list
In this project the program reads in the periodictable.dat into a node linked list while counting the amount of elements in the the file.
With that amount I create a dynamic array of the element and store them into it. Then I sort the array by the elements name.
